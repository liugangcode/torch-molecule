torch-molecule documentation
============================

Welcome to the torch-molecule documentation. torch-molecule is an actively developed package designed to facilitate molecular discovery through deep learning. It offers a user-friendly interface similar to `sklearn`, and includes model checkpoints for efficient deployment and benchmarking across various molecular tasks. The package currently focuses on three main components:

- Predictors: Molecular property prediction models that make predictions (regression or classification) based on molecular graphs.
- Generators: Molecular graph generators that generate new molecules.
- Encoders: Molecular graph encoders that convert molecular graphs into a vector representation.
